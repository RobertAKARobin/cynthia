  <p>I was introduced to the jewelry business as a child while “helping” my grandmother and mother with their jewelry business in Providence, Rhode Island.  Although I didn’t quite appreciate it then, those lessons learned while spending time around the shop turned out to be the foundation of my passion for fabricating jewelry in metal, enamels and glass. The fascination I had with all the colors they used back in the 1960’s is quite evident in my work today.</p>

  <p>Enameling has become the perfect medium for me to combine my love of color, glass, and metal.  The play of color in transparent and opaque enamels leads to endless possibilities and quite often, some welcomed surprises.  The different types of the metals used for enameling always provides for new surfaces and finishes that can be manipulated to deliver unique pieces and results.  Years of practice, experimentation and trial and error, otherwise known as learning the craft, have enabled me to use this traditional medium in a contemporary application to produce individual pieces that are personalized and representative of each owner’s preferences and interests.</p>

  <p>One of my specialties is fabricating custom symbolic wedding bands that are unique to only the couples who wear them. I encourage each customer to participate in the design of the ring, resulting in a very individualized piece of art. I often incorporate enamels and precious stones for added uniqueness. The rings are cast in precious metals to last a lifetime and to be handed down to become a special family heirloom.</p>

  <p>I have expanded my work with enameling to include hot glass in the form of flameworked and cast sculptures. Of course my love for color carries through in my glass work just as in my enameled jewelry. I have such a fascination with small creatures of the sea which propels my imagination to create the undiscovered. I also continue to fabricate colorful glass jewelry that is comfortable to wear and soothing to touch. After many years as a studio jeweler, I enrolled in a degree program at Salem Community College in New Jersey to complete a fine arts degree in glass art which melded my enthusiasm. I feel extremely fortunate to experience such joy in creating works of art for everyone who can appreciate the time and passion that makes it’s way into every one of my creations.</p>
